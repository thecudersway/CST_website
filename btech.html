            (Class Representative)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Greetings there! I, Apurva Anand, have immense interest in excelling
            every domain that I encounter. Born in valleys of Srinagar and
            grew up in nearly every corner of India. I cannot stop myself
            playing every sport there is, however I am a national level footballer. 
            I also acquire experience through exploring places, sketches and people.
            Moreover, here in CUPB, I always keep myself up in learning the evolving computer world.

          <h3>DEEPAK PRAKASH VERMA</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Deepak Prakash Verma, a proud B.Tech Computer Science
            student, caffeine-powered and running mostly on late-night bug fixes
            and YouTube tutorials. I believe Ctrl + Z is the greatest invention
            of all time. When I'm not trying to convince my code to work, I'm
            probably binge-watching tech reviews I'll never afford or dreaming
            about building the next big app (that I'll start… someday). I may
            not have figured out how to center a div on the first try, but I can
            definitely Google it like a pro. Tech geek, part-time debugger,
            full-time dreamer—that's me!

            professionally learning to talk to computers and occasionally win
            the fight. I'm into coding, hackathons, and chasing internships like
            they owe me money. When I'm not stuck in a semicolon error, I'm
            probably gaming, vibing to music, or pretending to be productive.

            in time for a game of chess . Lazy by nature, but always ready for a
            good challenge (especially if it doesn't involve moving too much)!
